## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

RsyncOSX and RsyncUI are GUIÂ´s on the Apple macOS plattform for the command line tool [rsync](https://github.com/WayneD/rsync). 

It is `rsync` which executes the synchronize task. The GUIÂ´s are only for setting parameters and make it more easy to use `rsync`, which is a fantastic tool.

### Very important to read and understand

The UI of RsyncOSX and RsyncUI can for users who dont know `rsync` be difficult to understand. Setting wrong parameters to rsync can result in deleted data. RsyncOSX nor RsyncUI will not stop you for doing so. That is why it is **very** important to execute a simulated run, a `--dry-run`, and verify the result before the real run.

Please read  the [documentation of RsyncOSX](https://rsyncosx.netlify.app/) or [documentation of RsyncUI](https://rsyncui.netlify.app/) for how to add a task and how to execute a simulated run, a `--dry-run`, to verify the task.  

### Version of macOS

If you have installed **macOS Big Sur**, RsyncOSX is the GUI for you. If you have installed **macOS Monterey** or **macOS Ventura**, you can use both GUIÂ´s in parallell.

### External task does the job

Please be aware it is an external task **not controlled** by RsyncOSX nor RsyncUI which executes the command line tool `rsync`. RsyncOSX and RsyncUI are monitoring the task for progress and termination. The user can abort a tasks at any time. Please let the abort to finish and cleanup properly before starting a new task. It might take a few seconds. If not the apps might become unresponsive.

One of many advantages of utilizing `rsync` is that it can restart and continue the synchronize task from where it was aborted.

### RsyncOSX

RsyncOSX is the only GUI which supports scheduling of task.
