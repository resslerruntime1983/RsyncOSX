## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

RsyncOSX and RsyncUI are GUIÂ´s on the Apple macOS plattform for the command line tool [rsync](https://github.com/WayneD/rsync). 

| App      | Lines of code | Swift files | Version 1.0 |  Latest version |
| ----------- | ----------- |   ----------- | -------- |  -------- |
| RsyncOSX   | about 160K   | 130       | 14 March 2016 |	6.7.6 - 13 Jan 2023|
| RsyncUI   | about 170K        | 170       | 6 May 2021 | 1.4.3 - 8 Feb 2023 |

| App      | Code | Paradigm |
| ----------- | ----------- |   ----------- |
| RsyncOSX   | Swift, Storyboard   | imperativ (Swift)      |
| RsyncUI   | SwiftUI, Swift | declarativ  (SwiftUI)     |

It is `rsync` which executes the synchronize task. The GUIÂ´s are only for setting parameters and make it more easy to use `rsync`, which is a fantastic tool.

### Important to verify

The UI of RsyncOSX and RsyncUI can for users who dont know `rsync` be difficult to understand. Setting wrong parameters to rsync can result in deleted data. RsyncOSX nor RsyncUI will not stop you for doing so. That is why it is **very** important to execute a simulated run, a `--dry-run`, and **verify** the result before the real run.

Please read  the [documentation of RsyncOSX](https://rsyncosx.netlify.app/post/rsyncosxdocs/) or [documentation of RsyncUI](https://rsyncui.netlify.app/post/rsyncuidocs/) for how to add a task and how to execute a simulated run, a `--dry-run`, to verify a task. 

### Version of macOS

If you have installed **macOS Big Sur**, RsyncOSX is the GUI for you. If you have installed **macOS Monterey** or **macOS Ventura**, you can use both GUIÂ´s in parallell.

### External task does the job

Please be aware it is an external task **not controlled** by RsyncOSX nor RsyncUI which executes the command line tool `rsync`. RsyncOSX and RsyncUI are monitoring the task for progress and termination. The user can abort a task at any time. Please let the abort to finish and cleanup properly before starting a new task. It might take a few seconds. If not the apps might become unresponsive.

One of many advantages of utilizing `rsync` is that it can restart and continue the synchronize task from where it was aborted.

### Parameters to rsync

`rsync` supports a ton of parameters and most likely the advanced user of `rsync` wants to apply parameters and verify the effect. I am **not** an advanced user of `rsync`, but both RsyncOSX and RsyncUI supports adding parameters. The GUI for verifying parameters is better within RsyncUI than RsyncOSX. Both apps can be used in parallell and if you prefer RsyncOSX you might still use RsyncUI to add and test parameters for `rsync`. The `rsync` command line is dynamically updated when updating parameters and presented in RsyncUI and there is a verify button for testing before saving. 

### RsyncOSX

RsyncOSX is the only GUI which supports scheduling of task.
