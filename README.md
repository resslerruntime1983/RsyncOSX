## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

RsyncOSX and RsyncUI are GUIÂ´s on the Apple macOS plattform for the command line tool [rsync](https://github.com/WayneD/rsync). The main difference between the two apps is how the User Interface (UI) is built. It is `rsync` which executes the synchronize data tasks. The GUIÂ´s are for organizing tasks, setting parameters to rsync and make it more easy to use rsync, which is a fantastic tool.

### Install by Homebrew

Both apps might be installed by Homebrew.

| App      | Homebrew | macOS |  Documentation |
| ----------- | ----------- |   ----------- |  ----------- |
| RsyncOSX   | `brew install --cask rsyncosx`  |  **macOS Big Sur** and later   |   [RsyncOSX](https://rsyncosx.netlify.app/post/rsyncosxdocs/) |
| RsyncUI   | `brew install --cask rsyncui`    | **macOS Monterey** and later     |   [RsyncUI](https://rsyncui.netlify.app/post/rsyncuidocs/) |

### Why two apps and latest versions

The development of RsyncOSX commenced in 2015 as a private project to learn Swift. In 2019, Apple released SwiftUI, which is a development framework for building user interfaces for iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, TVOS, and macOS. SwiftUI quickly became very popular, and after some investigation, I decided to commence another private project to learn SwiftUI. The model part of RsyncOSX was at that time quite stable, and I decided to refactor the GUI part of RsyncOSX by utilizing SwiftUI. And that is the short story behind the two applications.

There are two versions for RsyncUI, one for all versions of macOS including macOS Sonoma and one for only macOS Sonoma.  See the [changelog](https://rsyncui.netlify.app/post/changelog/) for more information.  

| App      | Lines & files | UI | Latest version  |  Version 1.0 | 
| ----------- | ----------- |   ----------- | -------- |  -------- |
| RsyncOSX   | about 11K, 121  | Storyboard, imperativ   | 6.8.0 - 13 April 2023 |	14 March 2016 | 
| RsyncUI   | about 14K, 165  | SwiftUI, declarativ     | 1.7.2 - 23 September 2023  | 6 May 2021  | 

According to Apple, SwiftUI is the future. In my own experience, coding in SwiftUI is easier and more predictable than by Storyboard and Swift, which are the basis for RsyncOSX. Both apps are maintained, but RsyncUI is the future, and new development is within RsyncUI. And with every new release of macOS, Swift and Xcode there are new exciting features in SwiftUI.

Both apps might be used in parallel, but not at the same time due to the locking of files. Data is read and updated from the same location on storage.

### Important to verify

The UI of RsyncOSX and RsyncUI can for users who dont know `rsync` be difficult to understand. Setting wrong parameters to `rsync` can result in deleted data. RsyncOSX nor RsyncUI will not stop you for doing so. That is why it is **very** important to execute a simulated run, a `--dry-run`, and verify the result before the real run.

### External task executing rsync 

Please be aware it is an external task *not controlled* by RsyncOSX or RsyncUI, which executes the command-line tool rsync. The progress and termination of the external rsync task are monitored. The user can abort the task at any time. Please let the abort finish and cleanup properly before starting a new task. It might take a few seconds. If not, the apps might become unresponsive.

### Parameters to rsync

`rsync` supports a ton of parameters and most likely the advanced user of `rsync` wants to apply parameters. Both RsyncOSX and RsyncUI supports utilizing parameters.
